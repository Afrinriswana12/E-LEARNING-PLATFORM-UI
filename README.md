DESCRIPTION:

Welcome to the E-Learning Platform UI project! This is a multipage front-end user interface built to simulate the core structure and functionality of a modern online learning platform. Designed with user experience in mind, this interface provides a clean and responsive layout for learners to browse courses, track progress, and access video-based learning materials.

✨ Project Overview
This project is a fully responsive multi-page user interface for an e-learning platform, crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers a sleek and modern design with intuitive navigation to simulate a real-world online learning experience. This front-end project is ideal for demonstrating design principles, component structuring, and front-end functionality in educational platforms.

The platform provides essential features such as course listing, progress tracking, and video embedding, all structured to reflect how a user would typically interact with a real e-learning system. Each page is tailored for a specific purpose, such as browsing courses, viewing individual course content, or tracking user learning progress.

🚀 Features
📝 Course Listing
A dedicated course catalog page where users can browse all available courses.

Each course is displayed as a card containing a title, description, instructor info, and image.

Courses are visually organized for ease of browsing and can be categorized or filtered in future updates.

🎯 Progress Tracking
Each user’s course progress is visually indicated using progress bars or badges.

Users can see how far they’ve come in a course, providing motivation and clarity on their learning journey.

Pages are structured in a way that allows for backend integration in the future to persist real-time progress.

🎥 Video Embedding
Embedded video players within course pages to simulate real content delivery.

Supports video playback with basic controls for a better learning experience.

Videos are placed in a clean and distraction-free layout to help users focus on content.

📄 Multipage Layout
A fully navigable structure with separate HTML pages for:

Home / Dashboard

Course Catalog

Individual Course View

Profile / Progress Page

Navigation menu and headers remain consistent across pages for a seamless experience.

💡 Technologies Used
HTML5 – For semantic and structured page layout.

CSS3 – For responsive design, layout styling, and animations.

JavaScript – For interactivity and dynamic updates like progress tracking.

📌 Purpose
This project was created as part of a UI/UX development practice to explore how a real-world e-learning front-end could be structured. It serves as a starting point for building a more robust, full-stack educational platform in the future. Whether you're a designer, developer, or student, this UI template can help you understand the basic flow of an e-learning system.
